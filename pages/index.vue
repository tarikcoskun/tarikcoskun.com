        I'm Tarık, a young Front-End developer from Turkey. I have been coding
        since 2018, when I started using Discord. I've always wondered how
        Discord bots work, so I started coding Discord bots. In 2019, I started
        creating Discord bot dashboards and since then, I'm creating websites
        using new technologies I learn.
